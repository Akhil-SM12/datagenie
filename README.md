I have uploaded the following documents- 2 pdfs.

It consists of my approach and visualization results.

Assumptions: 
The dataset with MAPE value  greater than 3 percent considered to be a white noise

The FS score is calculated for all values by just normalizing it in the scale of 0-10,

The minimum threshold is kept as median of the dataset

For the 3rd checkpoint, I faced problems in giving input data.

For the 4th checkpoint, the accuracy of the model has been improved but optimization of time is still in progress.

For the 5th checkpoint, the selection of optimal window size is done by grid search cv mechanism (still in progress).
